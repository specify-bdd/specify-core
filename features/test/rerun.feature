Feature: Rerun Failed Tests
    As a software developer
    I want to rerun previously failed tests
    In order to verify that changes I've made fixed the cause of the failure

    Background:
        Given that the "@specify-bdd/specify" NPM package is installed
        And that the "@specify-bdd/plugin-cli" NPM package is installed
        And a CLI shell

    Rule: Failed tests can be targeted for reruns

        @skip
        Scenario: Only failed tests are rerun
            Given that a "passing feature" file exists at "./features"
            And that a "failing feature" file exists at "./features"
            When a user runs the command "npx specify test"
            And a user runs the command "npx specify test --rerun"
            Then the last command's exit code should be a $failure
            And the console output should match $failingTestResult
            And the console output should not match $passingTestResult

        @skip
        Scenario: No tests are rerun after a 100% passing run
            Given that a "passing feature" file exists at "./features"
            When a user runs the command "npx specify test"
            And a user runs the command "npx specify test --rerun"
            Then the last command's exit code should be an $error
            And the console output should match $noTestsToRerun
        
        @skip
        Scenario: A previously failing test passes after a rerun
            Given that a "failing feature" file exists at "./features"
            When a user runs the command "npx specify test"
            And the code under test is modified so the issue is resolved
            And the user runs the command "npx specify test --rerun"
            Then the last command's exit code should be a $success
            And the console output should match $passingTestResult

        @skip
        Scenario: Rerun is attempted with no prior test run
            Given that a "failing feature" file exists at "./features"
            When the user runs the command "npx specify test --rerun"
            Then the last command's exit code should be an $error
            And the console output should match $noTestsToRerun
